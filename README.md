# Path-Flamingo

Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in pathology are often accompanied by detailed reports or notes that provide essential diagnostic insights. These reports not only highlight observations from specific regions within a slide but also offer a broader context, combining localized details with a comprehensive overview. By integrating these textual insights with slide-level image features derived from WSIs, there is immense potential to advance computational pathology.

Path-Flamingo is a specialized multimodal model designed to bridge the gap between visual and textual data in pathology. It utilizes pretrained TITAN (a slide-level encoder) features and employs a Perceiver Resampler as a multimodal adapter to align image features with textual information extracted from pathology reports. Importantly, this approach leverages the strengths of pretrained models, avoiding the need to retrain large components like the TITAN encoder or the language model. Instead, training is focused on the Perceiver Resampler, ensuring efficient adaptation to pathology-specific tasks.

The foundation of Path-Flamingo builds upon the advantages of the Flamingo model, known for its capability in few-task fine-tuning (in-context learning). This allows Path-Flamingo to generalize well to new tasks with minimal additional training, making it highly efficient for pathology applications.

The dataset used for Path-Flamingo is curated from repositories such as TCGA and GTEx and is designed to support a range of tasks, including instruction-based learning and multiple-choice questions. These tasks target critical pathological concepts, including:
	•	Morphology: Structural and cellular characteristics of tissues
	•	Diagnosis: Identification of diseases or conditions
	•	Grade: Severity or stage of the disease
	•	Prognosis: Likely outcomes and progression

Key Features of Path-Flamingo
	•	Few-Task Fine-Tuning: Builds on Flamingo’s in-context learning capabilities, allowing efficient generalization to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
